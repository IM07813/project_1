In this project, we utilize a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains housing data from Zameen.com.
Our primary objective is to predict house prices using various machine learning models, 
including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. By comparing the predictions of these models,
we aim to fine-tune their performance for improved accuracy. A detailed explanation of each step, along with relevant code snippets, 
is provided within the accompanying IPython Notebook (ipynb) file for further reference.
